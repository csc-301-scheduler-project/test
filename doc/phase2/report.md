# Phase 2 Report

## Initial Planning - October 20th
### Scrum Master:
The scrum master is a member of the team who helps facilitate the work of other members, while keeping them on task. The scrum master is the individual who deals with problems that may get in the way of product development, allowing the rest of the team to focus on the tasks they have chosen.

### Task breakdown:

Small - Small tasks are those that will take 2 to 3 hours to complete at most. Things like the basic HTML layout and small front end components will fall under this category.

Medium - Medium tasks are tasks that are larger than small tasks, but can still be finished within the day. There are general ideas of how to approach the task, but a concrete solution needs to be created and implemented.

Large - Large tasks are tasks that will take longer than a day to complete. They are tasks whose details we have not yet fully worked out. Upon learning more, large tasks will *most likely* be broken down into smaller tasks, and their categories reassigned.

### Other discussions:
- Zenhub was suggested for its burndown chart and to help with issue tracking.

- MVP: The minimum viable product will jsut display a list of courses that has the minimal amount of conflict.
