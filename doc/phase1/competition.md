## Griddy

Griddy is a web based course planning service. It helps students visualize their time table by allowing them to select a list of courses and time slots. Griddy will then display the time table according to the student’s choices, and note down any conflicts.

Our product is different as we will automate the process of selecting time slots. Instead of relying on the student to sort out the time slots themselves, we will simply generate all the possible combination of time slots that do not result in a conflict. The student will then be able to view all of them in order from “best” to “worst”.

The users for our course planning service will be the same audience as those that use Griddy. However, we will have different automation options available for students with different needs. For example, students who commute from far away will likely want their courses packed together during the middle of the day, to avoid getting up too early and getting home too late. Other students who work during the school term may not be able to attend class at specific times.

We believe the only group of users that would benefit more from Griddy would be users who intentionally wish to schedule conflicts in their time table. Some students do this because they require the credit for a course that conflicts with a course they cannot schedule elsewhere, and do not plan on attending one of these courses very often. Perhaps Griddy did not choose this route because it would take away some freedom of choice from users its users, or because they wanted to keep their feature set as minimal as possible. 

It would make our product less efficient if we were to cater to this group of user. Thus we will not address that specific user group.
