# Process
 
We used Slack for communications and a shared Google Drive folder containing documents that were associated with each part we had to submit for Phase 1 of the project. 

When making decisions, we would create a list of the pros and cons of the outcomes and then vote on which ideas we thought would be better. As an example, when we were deciding on our  project topic, we had everyone suggest and pitch ideas. Then we discussed the possibilities of each idea and put them to a vote. 

Since we are all quite busy, we mostly met online as it was most convenient and efficient. We only met in person when we had to, and for the meetings with the TA. Since we mostly met online, there wasnâ€™t really a fixed frequency of meetings. We would contribute when we had  time to do so, and then update each other on Slack. The only times that we got together as a whole group (online) was when we had to make decisions that would affect the team. For example, for the project topic suggestions, we set a deadline, and would suggest ideas and discuss the possibilities of each before putting it to a vote. When we had to finally pick the project topic, we set a time where we were all free to go online and held a vote. 

One of the things we will take forward with us is to set more mini deadlines for ourselves so that each of us can be sure that, as a team, we are on top of our work. We will also try to make more use of our tools, such as Slack. We are all pretty new to using it, and have only scratched the surface by using its basic functionality. However, we have discovered that they provide GitHub integration, Google Doc integration and a lot of other useful tools that will help us smooth out our workflow.
